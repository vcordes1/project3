To the reader,

	This is a combined project for discrete mathematics, and data structures.

	I will say that most of the files are self explanitory, those that are not
obvious will be documented within the file itself.  Feel free to look around and
enjoy the experience.

	The functions for discrete project 3 are in the "list.h" header file and are 
commented as such.  The testing directory will have a file named setTest.cc which 
will be the runnable for said project.

	Also contained within the testing directory will be listTest.cc,
stackTest.cc, and queTest.cc which are the primary runnables for the data 
structures project.

best regards
